# Part C
# You are now going to try to find the best rate of savings to achieve 
# a down payment on a $1M house in 36 months. 
# Since hitting this exactly is a challenge, we simply want your savings 
# to be within $100 of the required down payment.
# Assumptions:
# Your semiÂ­annual raise is .07 (7%)
# Your investments have an annual return of 0.04 (4%)
# The down payment is 0.25 (25%) of the cost of the house 
# The cost of the house that you are saving for is $1M

                (monthly_salary * (save_rate / 10000)))
        + current_savings * (0.04 / 12) # take any current savings, add the
        # monthly savings from salary and then add the ROI from current savings
        if months % 6 == 0: # if 6 months have passed
            annual_salary += semi_annual_raise * annual_salary # add the raise
